## Description

The point of this project was to refactor an existing Book Search Engine. It initally used RESTful API but has now been converted to use GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app is also built following the MERN stack with a react front end. Creating the TypeDefs and resolvers was easy enough for me the challenge was converting the client side of the application. My largest struggle was due to the nature of my changes it was hard to test as I went along. But that is something I can improve in the future.

## Installation
